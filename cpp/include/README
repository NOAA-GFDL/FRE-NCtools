This "include" directory is only for library features that
are not yet in the C++ release being used.  Note that to use these features
the C++ code should have statements like :

#if __cplusplus <= 202002L
#include "include/format"
#include "cartesian_product.hpp"
#endif

Also, once all the target compilers have the desired
features, the relevant contents of this directory can be
removed.
