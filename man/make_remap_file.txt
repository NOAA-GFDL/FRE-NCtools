NAME
----

make_remap_file - create cubic sphere grid remap file

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]

make_remap_file  --input_mosaic _input_mosaic_ --output_mosaic _output_mosaic_
    --remap_file _remap_file_ [--interp_method _method_]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

make_remap_file creates a remap file from cubic sphere grid to cubic
sphere grid. The ratio of grid size of input and output grid must be
integer. The purpose of this tool is to create remap file on single
processor for very high resolution grid (It will large processor count
and long time to create such file). Currently this tool can only remap
file for data on grid cell center.

OPTIONS
-------

*--input_mosaic* _input_mosaic_::

Specify the input mosaic information. This file contains list of tile files
which specify the grid information for each tile.

*--output_mosaic* _output_mosaic_::

Specify the output mosaic information. This file contains list of tile files
which specify the grid information for each tile. If output_mosaic is not
specified, nlon and nlat must be specified.

*--remap_file* _remap_file_::

Specify the file name that saves remapping information. If remap_file is
specified and the file does not exist, remapping information will be calculated
ans stored in remap_file. If remap_file is specified and the file exists,
remapping information will be read from remap_file.

*--interp_method* _interp_method_::

Specify the remapping algorithm to be used. Default is 'conserve_order1'.
Currently only 'conserve_order1', 'conserve_order2' remapping scheme are
implemented in this tool.

EXAMPLES
--------

Remap scalar and vector data onto different grid resolutions

----
$ make_remap_file --input_mosaic C3072_mosaic.nc \
    --output_mosaic C6144_mosaic.nc
    --remap_file remap_C3072_to_C6144.nc \
    --interp_method conserve_order2fregrid
