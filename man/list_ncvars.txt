SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
list_ncvars < <INPUT_NML>


DESCRIPTION
-----------
list the variables from a set of netCDF files, based on the options
provided.  Dimension variables are not printed.  The record dimension
is not counted towards the dimension rank for non-static variables.

Variables that end with "_T1", "_T2", and "_DT", and variables that
contain only character arrays are skipped.

OPTIONS
-------
_INPUT_NML_::
A Fortran namelist passed in from stdin with the name "input", with the variables:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| filename
| CHARACTER(len=NF90_MAX_NAME)

| list_static
| LOGICAL

| list_nonstatic
| LOGICAL

| var0d
| LOGICAL

| var1d
| LOGICAL

| var2d
| LOGICAL

| var3d
| LOGICAL

| var4d
| LOGICAL
|===

EXAMPLE
-------
Print all static, 1-d variables in netCDF file "file.nc"

[verse]
list_ncvars <<EOF
 &input
   filename = 'file.nc',
   list_static = .true.,
   list_nonstatic = .false.,
   var0d = .false.,
   var1d = .true.,
   var2d = .false.,
