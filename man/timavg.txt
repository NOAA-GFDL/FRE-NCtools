NAME
----

timavg - Average variables in a netCDF file over the time axis

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
timavg [-a] [-b] [-d] [-m] -o _ofile_ _file_ [_file_ ...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

timavg calls the Fortran program _time_average_ to calculate an average for
variables stored in a netCDF file over the time axis.

OPTIONS
-------

*-a*::
Ignore "average information does not agree" errors.

*-b*::
Adds time axis bounds and cell methods (CF convention)

*-d*::
Turns on command echo (for debugging).

*-m*::
Average time (instead of end time) for t-axis values

*-W*::
Suppress warning messages (use with caution).

*-w* _wght_::
Minimum fraction of missing data needed for valid data. Defaults to 0.0.

*-o* _ofile_::
Name of the output file.  Defaults to _timavg.nc_.

*-z* _level_::
If using NetCDF4, use deflation level.  Defaults to input file settings (-1).

*-s* _1|0_::
If using NetCDF4, use shuffle if 1 and don't use if 0. Defaults to input file
settings (-1).

*-h*::
Display this help and exit.

*-V*::
Output version information and exit.

_file_ [_file_ ...]
list netcdf files, each file will be a time record in the output file (the files
should be in chronological order)
