NAME
----

make_vgrid - make virtical grids for an FMS model

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
make_vgrid --nbnds _nbnds_ --bnds _z(1),...,z(nbnds)_ [options]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

make_vgrid is used to make a vertical grid for an FMS model.  It uses a
piecewise monotonic shape preserving cubic-spline algorithm to calculate the
grid cell location.  The output netCDF file contains information on the
supergrid with grid size equal to the model grid size multiplied by a refinement
factor of two.

Two algorithms are provided for creating vertical grid: Monotonic cubic
interpolation and the legacy algorithm that uses a cosine function to configure
grid cell location. The monotonic cubic interpolation is developed by Russell
Fiedler and the detail of the alrogithm is explained in
https://www.mathworks.com/content/dam/mathworks/mathworks-dot-com/moler/interp.pdf.
More details of the algorithm is available in

* F. N. Fritsch and R. E. Carlson, Monotone Piecewise Cubic Interpolation, _SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis_, 17 (1980), pp. 238-246.

* D. Kahaner, C. Moler, and S. Nash, _Numerical Methods and Software_, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1989.

*--nz* needs to be specified to use the monotonic cubic algorithm.  The legacy
algorithm is developed by Ron Pacanowski, and this older algorithm uses a cosine
function to do the interpolation. *--dbnds* needs to be specified to use the
legacy algorithm. Since monotonic cubic interpolation is a higher order
interpolation, it will produce smoother grid distance. It is strongly suggested
to use the monotonic cubic interpolation by specifying argument *--nz*.

OPTIONS
-------

Required Flags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*--nbnds* _nbnds_::
Specify number of vertical regions for varying resolution.

*--bnds* _z(1),...,z(nbnds)_::
Specify boundaries for defining vertical regions of varying resolution.

Optional Flags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*--nz* _nz(1),...,nz(nbnds-1)_::
Number of supergrid points (double number of model grid points) for each
vertical regions of varying resolution.

*--dbnds* _dbnds(1),...,dbnds(nbnds)_::
Nominal resolution of depth regions.

*--stretch* _stretch_::
stretching factor for last region. Default is 1 (no stretching)

*--grid_name* _gridname_::
Specify the grid name. The output grid file name will be grid_name.nc. The
default value is vertical_grid.

*--center* _center_::
Specify the center location of grid. The valid entry will be 'none', 't_cell' or
'c_cell' with default value 'none'. The grid refinement is assumed to be 2 in x
and y-direction when center is not 'none'. 'c_cell' should be used for the grid
used in MOM.


EXAMPLES
--------

Example 1: Use monotoic cublic spline interpolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

----
$ make_vgrid --nbnds 3 --bnds 10,200,1000 --nz 10,20
----

will make a grid file with 60 supergrid cells, 30 model grid cells
with refinement is 2.

In order to generate regions of constant resolution the user should specify 3
consecutive regions of constant resolution (only 2 for the first and last
regions are required.)

----
$ make_vgrid --nbnds 4 --bnds 0,180,200,5000 --nz 18,2,30 --center c_cell
----

will have constant resolution in the top 200m.

----
$ make_vgrid --nbnds 6 --bnds 0,100,120,200,220,5000 --nz 20,2,8,2,30  --center c_cell
----

will have constant resolution from 120m-200m.


Example 2: Use legacy algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

----
make_vgrid --nbnds 3 --bnds 0.,220.,5500. --dbnds 10.,10.,367.14286 --center c_cell
----

Will make a vertical grid similar to GFDL/CM2/ocn w/ 100 supergrid cells.
