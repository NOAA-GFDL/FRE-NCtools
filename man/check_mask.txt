NAME
----

check_mask - configure the processors which contain all land points

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
check_mask --grid_file _grid_file_ [options]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

check_mask is used to configure the processors which contains all land points to
be masked out for ocean model (*--model* ocean). It also is used to configure the
processors which contains all ocean points to be masked out for land model
(*--model* land). This program is supposed to run on single processor. This tool
will print out number of processors to be masked, layout of the domain, masked
out processors list. These information will be written into files, with file
name is `mask_table.n_mask.layout(1)Xlayout(2)`. The model is expected to read
file mask_table if you want to mask out some processors.

The ocean model is assumed to be logically rectangular grid and land model could
be multiple tiles grid (like cubic sphere grid with 6 tiles). For land model,
each processor list has three entries: layout position in x-direction, layout
position in y-direction and tile number. For ocean model, each processor list
has two entries: layout position in x-direction, layout position in y-direction.

The purpose of using mask domain is to decrease the processor usage without
decreasing the performance, without changing bits relative to the case run
without the mask domain option. The mask domain option acts to mask out regions
that have zero ocean points (i.e., points that are all land) in both the ocean
and sea ice models or mask out regions that have zero land points (i.e., points
that are all ocean) in land model

OPTIONS
-------

*--grid_file* _grid_file_::
Specify the grid file to be used in the model run. There are three possible
choices for the grid file.

1. Old version of grid (contains field wet). Old version of grid is only for
model = ocean.

2. solo mosaic grid which contains field gridfiles. It should be the ocean solo
mosaic and ocean_topog file needs to be specified. This is only valid for model
= ocean.

3. coupled mosaic grid which contains field lnd_mosaic. This is only valid for
model = land.

*--ocean_topog* _topog_file_::
Specify the topography information for ocean mosaic. The field name of the
topography is depth_tile# or depth when ntiles = 1, The topography data is
positive down. This option is only for model = ocean.

*--min_pe* _pe_number_::
Specify the smallest processor count to be checked.

*--max_pe* _pe_number_::
Specify the largest processor count to be checked.

*--layout* _x_layout_,_y_layout_::
Specify the layout to be checked. When layout is specified, --min_pe and
--max_pe will be ignored.


*--halo* _halo_size_::
Specify the halo size in the ocean model. When there is no ocean points on a
processor (including halo data), the processor will be masked out. Default value
is 1.

*--sea_level* _sea_level_::
Specify the sea level ( in meters ) and its value will be used to determine
land/sea mask. When topography of a grid cell is less than sea level, this grid
cell will be land, otherwise it will be ocean. Default value is 0

*--show_valid_only*::
When set, only layouts valid with OBC are shown.

*--nobc* _num_open_bc_::
Number of open boundary condition. Its value should be less than MAX_OBC
(current is 4 ). Default value is 0.

*--direction* _d(1),...,d(nobc)_::
Open boundary direction. Each element value should be west, east, south or
north.

*--is* _is(1),...,is(nobc)_::
Starting i-index for open boundary condition. The index is Fortran index.

*--ie* _ie(1),...,ie(nobc)_::
Ending i-index for open boundary condition. The index is Fortran index.

*--js* _js(1),...,js(nobc)_::
Starting j-index for open boundary condition. The index is Fortran index.

*--je* _je(1),...,je(nobc)_::
Ending i-index for open boundary condition. The index is Fortran index.

*--model* _model_::
Specify the component model. Its value could be _ocean_ or _land_. The default
value is _ocean_.

EXAMPLES
--------

. Use mask domain in fully coupled model for ocean
+
----
$ check_mask --grid_file ocean_mosaic.nc \
   --ocean_topog ocean_topog.nc \
   --min_pe 100 --max_pe 200 --model ocean
----
+
This will create a list of mask_table with filename
_mask_table.n_mask.layout(1)Xlayout(2)_, where _n_mask_ is the number of masked
domain processors, _layout(1)_ is the x layout value and _layout(2)_ is the y
layout value.  For example the file "mask_table.9.18x10" has layout=(18,10) and
9 domain processor is masked out.
+
To use this file in a FMS run, place the mask_table file in the INPUT directory.
Set ocean_model_nml layout variable to "layout(1),layout(2)", and the mask_table
variable to "INPUT/mask_table_file".  Set the coupler_nml ocean_npes variable to
(layout(1) x layout(2) - n_mask).  For the "mask_table.9.18x10" file example,
ocean_model_nml/layout = 18,10; ocean_model_nml/mask_table =
"INPUT/mask_table.9.18x10"; and coupler_nml/ocean_npes = 171.  (171 = 18*10-9).
+
NOTE: For coupled models using concurrent coupling, you may only wish to set
ocean_model_nml variable mask_table, and not set ice_model_nml mask_table. The
reason for avoiding the ice_model use of mask_table with fully coupled models is
that, 1. the mask_table for the sea ice may not be necessary for performance
enhancement in fully coupled models, and 2. most importantly, setting mask_table
for sea ice complicates the layout for the ice model in fully coupled models.

. Use mask domain in sea-ice model (baltic1 experiment, ocean, ice,
atmosphere and land are all on the same grid)
+
----
$ check_mask --grid_file baltic1_grid_spec.nc \
   --min_pe 60 --max_pe 80
----
+
This will create a list of mask_table with filename
mask_table.n_mask.layout(1)Xlayout(2). For example mask_table.26.6x11 has
layout=(6,11) and 26 domain processor is masked out. As in example 1, place the
file in the INPUT directory, set ocean_model_nml/layout = 6,11, and
ocean_model_nml/mask_table = "INPUT/mask_table.26.6x11".  Since this model has
the ocean, ice, atmosphere and land on the same grid, set these same variables
to the same value in ice_model_nml, atmos_model_nml, and land_model_nml.  The experiment
will run on 40 processors (6*11-26).
