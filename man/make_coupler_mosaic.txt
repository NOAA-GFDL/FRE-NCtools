NAME
----

make_coupler_mosaic - Generate exchange grids for FMS coupler

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
make_coupler_mosaic --atmos_mosaic _file_name_ --ocean_mosaic _file_name_ --ocean_topog _file_name_ [options]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

make_coupler_mosaic generates three exchange grids for the FMS
coupler. The output file includes exchange grid files for fluxes
between atmosphere and surface (sea ice and land), exchange grid files
for runoff between land and sea ice. There might be more than one
exchange grid files between two model solo mosaic because there might
be multiple tiles in a solo mosaic. The exchange grid information is
between model grid, not between super grid. We assume the refinement
ratio between model grid and super grid is 2. Currently we only output
the exchange grid on T-cell. Besides generating the exchange grid
files, make_coupler_mosaic also generates the coupler mosaic file (the
file name will be mosaic_name.nc) which contains the atmos, land and
ocean mosaic path, ocean mosaic topog path and exchange grid file
path. make_coupler_mosaic expects NetCDF format input.

OPTIONS
-------

Required
~~~~~~~~

*--atmos_mosaic* _file_name_::

Specify the atmosphere mosaic information. This file contains list of tile files
which specify the grid information for each tile. Each grid is required to be
logically rectangular grid. The file name can not be 'mosaic.nc'

*--ocean_mosaic* _file_name_::

Specify the ocean mosaic information. This file contains list of tile files
which specify the grid information for each tile. The file name can not be
'mosaic.nc'

*--ocean_topog* _file_name_::

Specify the topography information for ocean mosaic. The field name of the
topography is depth_tile# or depth when ntiles = 1, The topography data is
positive down.

Optional
~~~~~~~~

*--land_mosaic* _file_name_::

Specify the land mosaic information. This file contains list of tile files which
specify the grid information for each tile. Each grid is required to be
logically rectangular grid. When land_mosaic is not specified, atmosphere mosaic
will be used to specify land mosaic. The file name can not be 'mosaic.nc'.

*--wave_mosaic* _file_name_::

Specify the wave mosaic information. This file contains list of tile files which
specify the grid information for each tile. Each grid is required to be
logically rectangular grid. When wave_mosaic is specified, exchange grid
information between wave mosaic and ocean mosaic will be generated. Otherwise
none of both will be created.

*--interp_order* _order_::

Specify the order of conservative interpolation. Its value can be 1 ( linear
order ) or 2 ( second order ) with default value 2.

*--sea_level* _level_::

Specify the sea level ( in meters ) and its value will be used to determine
land/sea mask. When topography of a grid cell is less than sea level, this grid
cell will be land, otherwise it will be ocean. Default value is 0

*--mosaic_name* _mosaic_name_::

Coupler mosaic name. The output coupler mosaic file will be _mosaic_name_.nc.
default value is _mosaic_.

*--area_ratio_thresh* _threshold_::

Criteria to decide if an overlap between any two model is an exchange grid or
not. When overlap area/model grid area is greater than area_ratio_thresh, that
overlap is saved as exchange grid. The default value is 1.e-6

*--check*

Check the tiling error.

*--print_memory*

Debug memory usage.

*--rotate_poly*

Set to calculate polar polygon areas by calculating the area of a copy of the
polygon, with the copy being rotated far away from the pole.

*--verbose*

Print out messages during running.

EXAMPLES
--------

A sample call to make_coupler_mosaic that makes exchange grids for atmosphere,
land and ocean mosaic (atmosphere and land are coincident) is:

----
$ make_coupler_mosaic --atmos_mosaic atmos_mosaic.nc \
    --ocean_mosaic ocean_mosaic.nc --ocean_topog ocean_topog.nc
----
