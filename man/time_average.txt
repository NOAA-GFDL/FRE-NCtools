NAME
----

time_average - Average variables in a netCDF file over the time axis

DESCRIPTION
-----------

_time_average_ reads the variables in a netCDF file, and computes an average of
those variables over the time axis.  _time_average_ uses a Fortran namelist
_input_ to configure the application.

NAMELISTS
---------

*character(len=2048)*, dimension(MAX_FILES) :: _file_names_::
Input file names.

*character(len=2048) :: _file_name_out_::
Output file name.

*logical* :: _use_end_time_ = .true.::
Use the last time as the averaged time value if _.true._.

*logical* :: _verbose_ = .false.::
Be more verbose.

*logical* :: _add_cell_methods_ = .false.::
Adds time axis bounds and cell methods (CF convention)

*logical* :: _skip_tavg_errors_ = .false.::
Ignore "average information does not agree" errors.

*logical* :: _suppress_warnings_ = .false.::
Suppress warning messages (use with caution).

*real* :: _frac_valid_data_ = 0.0::
Minimum fraction of missing data needed for valid data. Defaults to 0.0.

*integer* :: _user_deflation_ = -1::
If using NetCDF4, use deflation level.  Defaults to input file settings (-1).

*integer* :: _user_shuffle_ = -1::
If using NetCDF4, use shuffle if 1 and don't use if 0. Defaults to input file
settings (-1).

*character(len=8192)* :: _command_line_::
String to add to the provenance (history) attribute to the output netCDF file.
