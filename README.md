# FRE-NCtools

FRE-NCtools is a collection of tools for creating grids and mosaics
commonly used in climate and weather models, the remapping of data among grids,
and the creation and manipulation of netCDF files.
These tools were largely written by members of the GFDL
[Modeling Systems Group](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/modeling-systems)
primarily for use in the
[Flexible Modeling System](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fms) (FMS)
[Runtime Environment](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fre) (FRE) supporting the
work of the
[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov)
(GFDL).

* mppncscatter -- Distribute FMS netCDF file for initializing a FMS climate model


### Grid Tools
* check_mask -- Configure the processors which contains all land points to be masked out for ocean model
* fregrid -- Convert from one grid resolution to another
* make_coupler_mosaic -- Generates three exchange grids for the FMS coupler
* make_hgrid -- Generate different types of horizontal grids
* make_land_domain -- Generate a land domain file

* make_regional_mosaic -- Generate horizontal grid and solo mosaic to regrid regional output onto a regular lat-lon grid
* make_solo_mosaic -- Generates Mosaic information between tiles
* make_topog -- Generate the topography for any Mosaic
* make_vgrid -- Generate a vertical grid for a FMS model
* remap_land -- Remap land restart file from one mosaic grid to another mosaic grid
* river_regrid -- Remap river network data from global regular lat-lon grid onto any other grid
* runoff_regrid -- Regrid land runoff data to the nearest ocean point
* transfer_to_mosaic_grid -- Convert older style grids to newer mosaic grid

### Statistical and Informational Tools

* list_ncvars -- List the variables in a netCDF file
* plevel.sh -- Interpolates data from model levels to pressure levels
* split_ncvars.pl -- Write the variables in a FMS netCDF file into multiple netCDF files, one file per netCDf field
* timavg -- Create a time average netCDF file
* ncexists -- Checks for variables and attributes in a netCDF file


### Other Tools
There are several tools that have parallel versions and can overcome memory and cpu constrains of the serial
counterpart. E.g. fregrid_parallel reproduces the functionality of fregrid, and among other things it is
commonly used to generate the remapping weights for high resolution grids.  (for further information, see the
"extreme fregrid" document).
The [Ocean Model Grid Generator](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/ocean_model_grid_generator) can be copied or
cloned from its GFDL homepage.


### User Documentation
Documentation on using individual tools may be obtained by running the tool without
arguments or with the `-h` or `--help` options. Usually this provides  a list of the
legal command line arguments, definitions of the arguments, a summary of the tool, and
examples.

Many of the tools are commonly used in conjunction with other tools or as part of a
workflow. The directory FRE-NCtools/t has numerous test scripts that exercise
some possible workflows and can provide context for use of the tools, and
the docs directory contains a summary catalog of them. As an example,
consider the script for CI test #3 (file Test03-grid_coupled_model.sh) : via a detailed
example this script shows the use order of make_coupler_mosaic, make_solo_mosaic,
make_hgrid, make_vgrid and make_topog for creating grids and mosaics for a coupled
model.

Additional documentation can be found in the documentation directory
( FRE-NCtools/docs ) and the
[FRE-NCTools wiki](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/FRE-NCtools/wiki/)


## Contributing to NCTools

The NCTools project encourages contributions from external parties.
This includes bug fixes and enhancements of existing code; even
entire external projects can be contributed as submodules.
Contribution requirements include :
 * The passing of existing unit tests when they are run in the CI system.
 * The (potential) addition of unit tests when adding new functionality.
 * For external projects, unit tests may be required and the unit tests
   should be run on the external CI system.

 Additionally, since NCTools is distributable via the Spack package manager,
 the NCTools team will need to be able to compile and distribute via Spack any
 submodules and their dependencies. Contributors are encouraged to provide
 Spack recipes for their projects.

## Building and Installation - General Information
FRE-NCtools has a collection of C and Fortran sources. Within GFDL, FRE-NCtools
is built using a recent version of the GNU and Intel C and Fortran compilers.
Compiler flags required for compilation are commonly set in
environment variables and the important ones include :

*  CC          (The C compiler command)
*  FC          (The Fortran compiler command)
*  CFLAGS      (The C compiler flags)
*  FCFLAGS     (The Fortran compiler flags)
*  LDFLAGS     (The linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
              nonstandard directory <lib dir>)

On many systems, information of the NetCDF headers and libraries
can be obtained by the nf-config and nc-config commands.

## Building and Installation - Possible minimum configuration

If you received this as a package, the standard:

```
cd FRE-NCtools
configure
make
make install
```

should be sufficient.  If you cloned the git repository, you must first run
the `autoreconf` command with the `-i` (or `--install`) option to install
missing autotools files:

```
cd FRE-NCtools
autoreconf -i
./configure
make
make install
```

## Building and Installation - Common options
The legal options to the `make` and the `configure` commands can be listed by the commands:
```
make --help
configure --help=recursive
```

It is common to compile into a build directory (e.g. named `build`) and
install into an installation directory (e.g. with full path `<install path>`).
For example:

```
cd FRE-NCtools
autoreconf -i
mkdir build && cd build
../configure --prefix=<install path>
make
make install
```

### Parallel NCTools applications
The option  `--with-mpi` to the `configure` command will configure for building
parallel running versions of certain FRE-NCtools applications.

### OpenACC-enabled NCTools applications
The option `--enable-acc=yes` to the `configure` command will configure for building
the fregrid_acc executable that is capable of offloading computation to GPUs.  Currently, only
NVIDIA compilers are supported to enable OpenACC directives in fregrid_acc and libfrencutils_acc.
Please ensure that `FC=nvfortran` and `CC=nvc`.

## Building on a GFDL-managed system
The recommended environment with the recommended autoconf defaults can be loaded by running
the output generated by the site-specific `env.sh` script. The script are run before running
the autoreconf command, and  they are located in the [site-configs](site-configs) directory.
For example:

```
# Note: env.sh builds a set of commands to configure the environment.
# The back quotes (not single quotes!) do command substitution, using the
# standard output of env.sh as input to "eval". eval then executes the
# set of environment-setting shell commands.
eval `site-configs/<site>/env.sh`
```


## Compiler Requirements.

A compiler with support for the C99 standard is required since NCTools release 18.1.
Compile time errors may be generated by compilers that do not support this standard,
and upgrading to a sufficiently recent compiler version is recommended in this case.
NCTools has been built and tested with GCC and Intel compilers.
